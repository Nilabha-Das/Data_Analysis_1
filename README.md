# 📊 Purchase & Sales Data Analysis Report

This project showcases a **data analysis case study** using Python, focused on two business datasets: **Purchase** and **Sales**. The goal is to extract insights, identify patterns, and present findings in a clean, professional report.

## 📝 Project Summary

I performed end-to-end analysis on two Excel files—`PurchaseReport_01_01_25_to_31_05_25.xlsx` and `PurchaseReport_01_01_25_to_31_05_25.xlsx`—to uncover trends, key metrics, and correlations between purchasing and sales behaviors. All results are compiled into a visually rich PDF report.

### 🔍 Key Highlights

* Imported and cleaned Excel datasets using **Pandas**
* Explored trends in quantities, product categories, and sales cycles
* Created visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
* Exported insights to a formatted **PDF report**
